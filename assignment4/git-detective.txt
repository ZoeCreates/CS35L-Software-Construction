Firstly I use this command git log --grep="merge-tree" --oneline  to find out the commits related to merge-tree. Then git log --grep="merge-tree" --since="2022-07-01" --until="2022-12-12" --oneline helps me narrow down the search to commits made before 2022-12-12 but after the previous release. In the output I found out two commits with message thatâ€™s possibly descripting a fix to the segfault listed below:



bcf22f29df Merge branch 'js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo' into maint-2.38

19118cb857 Merge branch 'js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo'


I then use the command git show to inspect those commits and confirmed my answer:

[classzxi@lnxsrv11 ~/git]$ git show bcf22f29df
commit bcf22f29df87f25582de0ac9274d1567fa16be6f
Merge: 7f8a6caee5 92481d1b26

    Merge branch 'js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo' into maint-2.38
    
    In read-only repositories, "git merge-tree" tried to come up with a
    merge result tree object, which it failed (which is not wrong) and
    led to a segfault (which is bad), which has been corrected.
    
    * js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo:
      merge-ort: return early when failing to write a blob
      merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories
